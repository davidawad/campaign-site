                     <br/>
                     The stock market is a casino. We should reduce the long term capital gains tax to incentivize long term behavior.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     We need to incentivize people to take risks. Starting a business should be as cheap as possible until taxes are appropriate.

                     <br/>
                     There must be clear tax breaks for startup companies that help the environment and bring jobs to New Jersey.

                     <br/>
                     Too much money is wasted every year prosecuting nonviolent drug offenses and ruining lives. NJ must decriminalize drug use and vacate sentences.

                     <br/>
                     We must strategically deregulate healthcare over the next ten years to realign free-market incentives and make healthcare cheaper and more affordable to everyone.
                     <br/>
                     <br/>
                     We can't continue without clarity of healthcare pricing. All healthcare providers must make FHIR compliant data feeds available of exact prices for all billing codes and their insurance networks.

                     You should be able to get a tax bill online and pay it in five minutes, even with bitcoin if you want.
                     <br/><br/>
                     NJ can lead the nation by adopting the one trillion dollar blockchain industry for government services.
                     <br/><br/>
                     We need harsh penalties for government accountability. If a public servant is convicted for a crime within their scope of agency they can never serve the public in any capacity ever again.

                     We must remove obstacles to legal voter registration and voting by advocating for automatic voter registration, same day registration, online registration, early voting, vote-at-home options, and/or by making election day a holiday.

            <div>
               <h1 class="heading-h1">Hey there,</h1>
               <br>
               <p class="">
                  My name is David Awad, and I'm running for the State Assembly in New Jersey's 18th district.
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  I'm not here to sell you on slogans. The problems that the state faces will take decades to solve, and it's going to take a collection of serious leaders to solve them. New Jersey's debt to asset ratio is over 400% [1]. We have the seventh-highest tax burden in the country [2], Over 30% of the state's businesses have closed in the last year [3], housing prices in New Jersey continue to skyrocket [4], and over 62% of Americans overall believe the American dream is dead [5].
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  Anyone who looks at the problems facing society right now and believes that one party is right about everything is entirely missing the point. Social media is not the real world, and we need more legislators to start acting like it. We need democrats, republicans, and libertarians to start getting serious about suggesting real solutions to the state's problems.
                  </br>
                  </br>
                  Being a legislator would be a fantastic opportunity to give back to this state's beautiful people. I'm here to talk to constituents, listen to the experts, learn from my mistakes and try to make sound decisions. If that appeals to you, then I'd sincerely appreciate your support. I'm not here to ask you for your vote. I'm here to earn it.
               </p>

               <p>
                  I look forward to the chance,
               </p>
